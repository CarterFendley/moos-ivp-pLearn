This folder contains code to execute reinforcement learning based behavior
generation. Format:

-->"learning_code" contains all the scripts and files necessary to build and
    train a reinforcement learning model

--> "simulation_engine" contains launch scripts and infrastructure to run the
    simulations called by the scripts contained within learning code

--> Not Included in this folder is the source code for BHV_Input which is used
    to run the trained model in simulation by taking in a table. That can be
    found under moos-ivp-argupta/src/lib_behavior-test/

For more specific information for each folder, reference the README within
that folder.
